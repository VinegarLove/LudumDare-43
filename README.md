# Project made for the Ludum Dare 43
## This was made in 48 hours

My second ludumdare, this time i took the jam hoping to have enough time.

Sadly, i could work as much as i did in the Compo, so the game isn't that great;
Howerver, i had a blast making it and i discovered many more stuff about godot.

(Also, a friend helped me for the artwork! Nice!)

I'll leave an itch.io link soon.

Background:
You're a vampire, angels invaded your house. Cleanup everything.

SHIFT = Attack
SPACE = Jump
A = go left
D = go right
